  📚 <strong>Project Name:</strong> Tracking Stocks Analysis
</p>


## 📝 Abstract

Tracking stocks are common stocks of a firm that enable investors to track the success of a specific business unit within a conglomerate structure. This project aims to explore the design, benefits, and drawbacks of tracking stocks while examining the existing empirical literature on this topic. The analysis reveals that tracking stocks can provide value to certain types of firms, offering a unique equity structure that combines external financing via the market with internal financing.

## 📁 Modules

📌 **STOCK ADD**
> This module is responsible for adding new tracking stocks to the system. It allows users to input relevant information about the stock, such as the company, business unit, and financial data. Once added, the stock becomes available for tracking and analysis.

📌 **STOCK TRACK**
> The stock tracking module allows users to monitor the performance of the tracking stocks they have added. It provides real-time updates on stock prices, historical data, and key performance indicators. Users can analyze the progress of individual business units and make informed investment decisions based on the tracked data.

📌 **API's for Prediction and Live Data (ALPHA Vantage)**
> To enhance the project's functionality, we have integrated the ALPHA Vantage API for accessing prediction models and live data. This integration allows users to obtain accurate forecasts and real-time information related to the tracked stocks. Utilizing the power of ALPHA Vantage API, we aim to provide users with valuable insights for making informed investment choices.
